Some how-tos, best practices and tricks when working with botpress

# Why this repo?
There are plenty 'how-to'request (in the slack group) so I decided to create a repo that hold everything. The aim of this repo
is to serve as the quick reference on how to implement anything the developer is not clear on without necessarily reading through
a long tutorial just for a few lines of code.

## ISSUES

###### Specified router not working on heroku
So after I deployed my bot to heroku, the router I specified (see sample code in Server/Expose.js) stopped working. I solved this by using the [botpress webhook module](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-webhook). Perhaps this is an issue with botpress, I am yet to figure out, yet to check it out in the core. Perhaps [Botpress X](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/tree/develop/x-merged) would fix that...
The error I get from Heroku was a `401` error. This is a good clue incase anybody wants to figure it out.

## HOW-TOs

###### How to listen for Quick reply buttons/Location buttons in a convo thread?

Simply set the `convo.messageTypes` to an array containing whatever message/event type you want to listen for. Check out the code snippet example [here](https://github.com/OAyomide/awesome-botpress-messenger-tricks-howtos/blob/master/Convo/LocationButton.js)

###### How to prevent DialogFlow from intercepting messages
There are times when you'd need the dialogFlow module not to mess up your flow. For example, when you are taking user data/information from a user --Email for example. When the user inputs the information, it triggers something else instead of being stored or something. To prevent this, you simply re-arrange the middleware.
> The reason the text sent to the user is processed by the DialogFlow module is because messages coming into the middleware are process by the order in which the middleware is arranged. When you jus install the module, it gets arranged at the top. Please go [here](https://botpress.io/docs/advanced/middleware)
