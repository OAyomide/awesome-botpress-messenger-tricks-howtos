Some how-tos, best practices and tricks when working with botpress

# Why this repo?
There are plenty 'how-to'request (in the slack group) so I decided to create a repo that hold everything. The aim of this repo
is to serve as the quick reference on how to implement anything the developer is not clear on without necessarily reading through
a long tutorial just for a few lines of code.

###### Pull requests are definitely welcome
